        <h2>A Happier, Healthier Way to Work</h2>
        <span
          >The scientifically-proven cure for all our workday sitting problems.
        </span>
        <p>
          No matter how much we focus on our health, the quintessential American
          work routine rarely allows us to harness the health benefits of
          movement. Between our morning and afternoon commutes, company
          meetings, desk work, and catching our favorite TV show on the couch,
          we spend most of our waking hours sitting down. What's a surefire
          antidote to all this workday sitting? Scientifically-proven,
          height-adjustable desks (also known as standing or sit/stand desks)!
          In comparison to a fixed standing desk, which can be just as bad for
          you as a traditional sitting desk, a height-adjustable desk cultivates
          the health benefits of movement by allowing users to freely switch
          from a sitting position to a standing position every hour or so. A
          growing body of research supports the benefits of standing desks and
          the myriad of ways they improve your life, from boosting productivity
          and preventing adverse health conditions caused by sedentary habits to
          increasing the probability of a pain-free workday by 80%.

        height-adjustable desk.</span

      <div class="paragraphs-container">
        <div class="para">
          <h3>1. Increase Your Energy</h3>
          <p>
            Using a standing desk helps create the movement you need to improve
            circulation and deliver oxygen to the brain, which will increase
            your energy and attentiveness.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
          <h3>2. Lose Weight</h3>
          <p>
            Lose almost six pounds a year by standing instead of sitting for six
            hours a day. Standing burns 12% more calories than sitting.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
          <h3>3. Improve Your Mood</h3>
          <p>
            Those who sit for more than six hours per day show more signs of
            psychological distress than those who sit less. Standing at your
            desk has been shown to improve your mood and reduce depression,
            fatigue, and tension.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
          <h3>4. Improve Mental Focus</h3>
          <p>
            Moving enhances the creation of new brain cells, improving critical
            thinking and focus.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
          <h3>5. Harness Joint & Muscle Movement</h3>
          <p>
            The musculoskeletal movement required to consistently transition
            from sitting to standing counteracts the health repercussions of a
            sedentary workday routine.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
          <h3>6. Lower Your Risk of Disease</h3>
          <p>
            A sedentary, physically inactive lifestyle is the fourth leading
            cause of mortality worldwide. Standing has been linked to lower
            rates of heart attacks, strokes, and diabetes.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
          <h3>7. Boost Your Productivity</h3>
          <p>
            Standing at your desk has been shown to raise productivity by up to
            45%.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
          <h3>8. Reduce Caffeine Intake</h3>
          <p>
            Periodic standing sessions—rather than coffee or energy
            drinks—provide a more natural defense against those pesky afternoon
            crashes.
